Welcome to my todolist application. 
I created this project to manage the forms. The goal is to get the information from the field and send it to the DOM.

## programming language

This Todolist was made with javascript, HTML and CSS. 

### How it works 

We have a field that allows us to create a task and add it to a list of tasks. Once the task is created we can delete it, modify it or note it as done.

### Areas of improvement 
Add a local storage and a bdd to to record the different tasks.
